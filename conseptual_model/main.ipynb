    "Our main concern in this project is to clarify how remote work influences productivity and performance. The following conceptual model is our hypothesis assumed with the underlying researches conducted by Sheshadri(2022) and Teevan(2022). The former study shows that the relationship between remote work flexibility and employees satisfaction and their productivity, which lead to organization performance, using a Structural Equation Model (SEM). It also tries to make it clear how Top Management Support and Organization Policy affects on the remote work flexibility. Although the paper reaches to a certain conclusion regarding the relationships, we finds out that it does not involve with other variables which might have impact on productivity and performance. Teevan(2022) compiles a wide variety of researches on WFH in global, which published as \"Microsoft New Future of Work Report 2022\", and it gives us deeper insights to reinforce the former study. For instance, it describes the result of surveys looking into the meanings of employee's satisfaction as well asl their productivity. According to the questionnaire, employees' satisfaction has three components, such as 'Subjective','Self-realization' and 'Social connectivity'. It explains that meeting video privacy is tightly connected to employee's performance and so on. After reading these papers, we figure out that combining the perspectives from them enables to build superior conceptual model which could explain the relationship regarding WFH. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram depicts the model, which improves Sheshadri(2022)'s model with additional perspectives from Teevan(2022) as follows;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. External factors\n",
    "\n",
    "   Flexibility does not change by only Top Management Team Support and Organization Policy but also, some other variables, such as industry, number of employees and, cost and budget. It is more challenging for supermarket stores to offer staff remote wort options than It companies. The larger firms are able to implement WFH infrastructure more easily compared to SMB because they can assign redundant budget to the additional resources. External factors have such variables which might impact on remote work flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Privacy Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "   As we mentioned, Teevan(2022) unveils the fact that online meeting video privacy could be one of the most significant factors for employee's productivity and mental health. Those who does not have an option to turn on/off a video camera feels more stress and less safe, which would lead to burn out. Thus, Privacy Flexibility should be included in remote work flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Workplace barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sheshadri(2022) mentions Workplace Flexibility but it only refers to the right to choose where to work. However, it is easy to imagine workplace amenities and environment would impact on remote work flexibility. \"The Leaf Blower Problem\" is an open challenge for online meeting according to the Microsoft survey. It implies that when we share the same room, we implicitly understand how we are perceived. However, in a remote meeting, a lack of common ground may lead to misunderstandings about what others perceive\". Furthermore, home office environment like inadequate lighting, bad room air quality and anything which are supposed to be controlled by a company in an office would disturb employees' concentration. In this context, we add this perspective to the conceptual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Work Preference\n",
    "\n",
    "   When it comes to employees' productivity and satisfaction, remote work flexibility is not only the factor to determine them. Whether they like WFH or not would be related to their individual performance because if an employee prefers WFH than office work, but the company does not offer WFH flexibility, the gap may trigger to make the individual feel stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Employees Satisfaction and Productivity are drilled down into some components\n",
    "\n",
    "   Teevan(2022)'s research helps us to redefine what employee satisfaction and productivity are. It describes that the meanings of productivity and satisfaction differ depending on personal thoughts. Therefore, we categorize them into some components so that we can obtain deeper insights from our analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Social Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Microsoft paper consists of four parts; individual result, team result, organization result and social result. It is very reasonable to organize the effect of WFH and hybrid work. Although it does not deeply investigate how they are related to each other, we put social performance which might be affected by the entire population of companies' performance. \n",

    "To investigate the relationship, we implement data model on the underlying conceptual model. The Remote Work Survey, conducted two waves in 2020 and 2021 at New South Wales in Australia, is very insightful dataset containing 180 questions in total. Each wave collects answers from 1,500 responses. Some questions are multiple questions or the ones in Likert Scale, while other are free text questions. Although what the surveys asked respondents is pretty similar, the questionnaire formats are different. For instance, the format of a question in the first wave was six multiple choices, whereas the same question was split into six questions in the second wave, which forces me to investigate and re-organize 73 + 109 questions one by one so that we can compare the results in those years.​\n",

    "Various analysis approaches are applied to the relationships based on underlying this model. First of all, we try to carry out professional visualization with classis statistic methods. Since our conceptual model is very complicated, it is not easy to implement SEM to comprehend how the attributes are correlated to. Although we are not able to see interaction effect, latent factor or any confounding factor, classic statistical test is a simple way to show how either of two variables are correlated to. Thus, classic statistical test approach is what we have done here. To make this analysis easier, we use just the second wave data(2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, there are two types of variables, quantified variables and qualified variables. The qualified variables are boiled down into nominal scale and rank scale. If there are more than three levels in a qualified variable, we also conduct another types of tests to investigate which levels are correlated. This classification determines types of statistical tests and correlation computation methods. As you can see below, the analytics method structure explains what we do for the professional visualization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on types of two variables, the statistical test we employ differs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two quantified variables\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is the easiest case. To see if they are correlated, Weltch's T test is carried out. Since the data comparison is independent unlike a Before-After comparison regarding a single respondent, we employ the unpaired test. There would be some cases where the Student T test or Mann-Whitney U test is more appropriate but, it is not the best way to execute multiple tests for a single case. Weltch's T test does not consider if a variable is normally distributed, its populations has equal variance. In other words, this test can be applicable for any cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One is quantified and another is qualified variable\n",
    "\n",
    "  First, we use the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine if the quantified variable is normally distributed. If it is, we then perform the Bartlett test to check for populations of variance equality. When a variable would have more than three levels, multiple arrays has to be tested with Shapiro-Wilk. Applying the test for each array would lead misunderstanding of the test result because it's repeated multiple times. To solve this challenge, we conduct Bonferroni correction in order to more strictly check the statistical significance by dividing p-values with the number of tests.\n",
    "  If both normal distribution and equal variances are confirmed, we proceed with a one-way ANOVA for more than two groups, whereas Kraskal-Wallis Test is applied to the case when both are normally distributed but equal variance is not confirmed with its populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "  After the one-way ANOVA or Kraskal-Wallis tests, correlation strengths are computed with correlation ratio method or Spearman's Correlation. If a qualified variable is in nominal scale, correlation ration is applied. In contrast, if it's in rank scale, correlation is measured with Speamans' Correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "  When the variables has more than three levels, we investigate which levels are correlated by Tukey's test or Steel-Dwass's test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two qualified variables\n",
    "\n",
    "  If both variables are on a nominal scale, we apply the Chi-square test. In the case of which a significant association is found, we  perform Cramers'V to measure the correlation strength. On the other hand, it either of them is on a rank scale, Spearman's Correlation is employed. For a variable with more than three levels, a Chi-square residual analysis is done to identify specific cells contributing to this association.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selection of the statistical test depends on the type of data (quantified or qualified) and the scale (nominal or rank). For quantified variables, tests like Welch's T test or one-way ANOVA are used, while for qualified variables, depending on their scale, we might use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test, Chi-square test, or Steel-Dwass test. Non-parametric tests are preferred when the data do not meet the assumptions of normal distribution and equal variances.\n",

    "We investigate the correlation between TMS and INF. The top 5 pairs of questions shows the correlation strength is over 0.4, which somewhat correlated. Technically speaking, it mainly describes how poor management improvement influences the infrastructure flexibility such as IT H/W and S/W equipment , cyber security. Looking into which levels contributes to the strength, you may realize the all the levels consistently explain the correlation. As you can see the second heatmap, it shows zeros for all the tabulated values. The value is the residual, that is the difference between the expectations and observations. If its absolute value is over 1.96, that indicates the occurrence of the difference is very unlikely. Otherwise, it shows zero. This graph shows all of values are zero. However, you can see the Spearman's correlation shows somewhat they are correlated. The integrated result lead us to conclude all the levels contributed to the difference. Other top 5 pairs also describes similar results. This is pretty convincing because Sheshadri(2022) also shows TMS commits to INF significantly.\n",
